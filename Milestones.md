## Phase II: Propose approach to answer research question(s)

* Few minutes review of what you said in survey & main approaches & their shortcoming.
* Give your proposed approaches.
* Provide a general idea of how (method) you plan to validate your approaches.

## Phase III:  Experimental results and evaluation of own proposed approach & compare with baseline(s)
